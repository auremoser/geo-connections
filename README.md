###geo-connections

geo-connections is an experiment with CartoDB's Static Maps API, to demo some of the functionality and test with a v-day usecase.

We asked attendees at this month's geo-nyc to send in the name and location of someone they missed. Then we made a carto map to pull in those data, plot them by id and export them as images for postcard valentines to share this holiday (Feb. 14th).

This repository hosts the files, htmltemplates and js code and exported pngs to make it work.

More about the exact steps to make this happen and some support resources in the `process.md` file in this repo.
