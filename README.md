###geo-connections

geo-connections is an experiment with CartoDB's Static Maps API, to demo some of the functionality and test with a v-day usecase.

The Static Maps API allows you to access your carto maps and export them as .pngs or other image files for print and sharing. We wanted to fine a slick print use-case to demo what it can do, and voil√†, V-Day approaches!

We asked attendees at this month's geo-nyc to send in the name and location of someone they missed. Then we made a carto map to pull in those data, plot them by id and export them as images for postcard valentines to share this holiday (Feb. 14th).

This repository hosts the files, html templates and js code and exported pngs to make it work.

More about the exact steps to make this happen and some support resources in the `process.md` file in this repo.
